    {name:'RoyalT Rings',link:'/shop/engagement-rings?ItemDetail_16=RoyalT',description: `
    The RoyalT engagement rings are 2CT+ rings because they are designed in a way that decorates the side-profile of the band in small pave-diamonds.
    `,img:RoyalTRing},
    {name:'RoyalT Bands',link:'/shop/wedding-bands?ItemDetail_16=RoyalT',description:`
    The RoyalT bands are fantastic anniversary/right-hand bands that fit comfortably and are definite show-stoppers.  The large carat total weight, and attention to detail on the sides represents Tacori"s remarkable alure.

    {name:'Founders',link:'/shop?ItemDetail_16=Founders',description:`
    Haig does it again! Our founder, Haig Tacorian,
    has created a special new Tacori style,
    previewed here for the first time ever.
    Haig has designed an entirely new diamond-studded way to sign
    the ring at the foundation.  And yet, the Founders Special still offers the clean lines and elegant simplicity of a classic solitaire.  This is the beginning of something big.

    {name:'Dantela',link:'/shop?ItemDetail_16=Dantela',description:`
    The Dantela represents a simplified Halo that lets the center-stone do the talking.  It is also encased in a beautiful weave of platinum.
    `,img:Dantela},
    {name:'Petite Crescent',link:'/shop?ItemDetail_16=Petite Crescent',description:`
    The Petite Crescent offers elevated height and side-profile but with a beautiful slender width.  We love this design and it continues to be one of Tacoris  best collections.
    `,img:Petite},
    {name:'Full Bloom',link:'/shop?ItemDetail_16=Full Bloom',description:`
    The Full Bloom encases the center-stone in diamonds, making the whole ring the center of conversation rather than the center-stone.
    `,img:FullBloom},
    {name:'Reverse Crescent',link:'/shop?ItemDetail_16=Reverse Crescent',description:`
    The Reverse Crescent is a beautiful reverse arch, allowing for windows-of-light to shine through the side-profile.
    `,img:ReverseCrescent},
    {name:'Gents Bands',link:'/shop/wedding-bands?ItemVendorName=Tacori',description:`
    Last but not least, we have matching Gents bands for the wedding-bands, each Gent band comes with a Stainless Steel sports band.
