    question: 'How do I get the right size?',
    answer: `
    We measure your finger with a ladies ring-sizer that is about 2-3MM wide.  We will check to see if you’re finger is consistent or if you’re hands are running hot/cold for the day, find the tightest part of the finger, either the knuckle or the back of the finger depending on the person. The average ring-size is between a size 5-7, and any ring can be ordered in the size that best fits the finger.

    question: 'Will my engagement ring size be the same as my wedding band size?',
    answer:`
    We suggest if the wedding band will have diamonds going all the way around, we order/make the ring about .25 size larger than necessary, the band will sit behind the engagement ring for protection and allows for hands to change size as time goes on.

    question: `My knuckle is the largest part of my finger, how do we take that into consideration?`,
    answer:`
    In cases where the knuckle is larger than the smaller part of the finger by a substantial amount, we suggest to either add a spring or speed-bump within the band; this will prevent turning of the ring in either the engagement ring or wedding band.  If the band is eternity with diamonds going all the way around, it is not necessary due to diamonds going all the way around the band.
