      Ladies bands are traditionally worn closest to the heart -- on the inside of the finger, and may need to be made looser than the engagement ring due to the fact that
      diamonds may be set all the way around, causing issues in re-sizing for future needs.  A few different aspects to look out for are:

      {title:'Shank',
      description:` Shank type such as curving the band or leaving it straight is often dependant on the engagement ring, as most wearers like to enjoy their ring with both rings sitting flush together.
      You can also get a very pleasant look changing the shank of the wedding band to create nice pattern and design that can compliment the engageement ring as well.
      `
    },
      {title:'Width',
      description:`Width for a ladies band ranges from 1.5 - 5mm, and is often dependant on the length of the finger joint, how wide the engagement ring size, and overall look trying to achieve.
      We do not suggest going lower than 1.5mm due to longevity issues from out-of-rounding bands and having diamonds or other stones becoming loose.
      `
    },
    {title:'Thickness',
    description:`Thickness is one of the traits that goes unnoticed when trying to find the perfect band.  The engagement ring if set up high enough should have enough clearance for the band to sit flush.
    Sometimes however, this does not happen, and a lower band that will be less obtrusive in daily activity should be desired.  Stones need a certain amount of depth for the diamonds to be set as well.
    `

  {title:'Setting Style',
  description:`
    Setting-style can range from channel-set, u-prong-set, bright-cut, and onwards.  In the example ring, we show a bead-set design, which compliments the round diamonds eternity-set along the entire band.
