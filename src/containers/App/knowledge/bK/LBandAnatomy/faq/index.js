    question: 'How would we go about matching my engagement ring with my wedding band?',
      answer: `
       We would first look at how the diamonds are set on the engagement ring, it is the most common strategy to follow in-line with the diamond setting style.  The next step is to match the metal, not just the color, since the life-time repair is easier if both rings are done in the same metal.
       Side-profile such as Tacori's pieces are then taken in consideration to have a perfectly matching wedding band to go with the engagement ring.

    question: 'Can ladies bands be engraved? ',
    answer:`
    Yes wedding bands can be engraved with there is a solid piece behind the set stones.  They would need to be engraved by either a hand-engraver or a lazer-engraver which we have access to.

    question: 'Do most people go all the way around with diamonds or half-way?',
    answer:`
      Going all the way around with diamonds is useful with a lady's band as it will rotate evenly and get wear evenly throughout the lifetime of the piece.  We most often get people wishing they would have gone eternity over half-way around.
