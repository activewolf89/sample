    question: 'What styles are out there?',
    answer: `
    Classic Ladies band ideas that come to mind are bands that will match the engagement ring, either matching the side-profile of the engagement ring and/or how the diamonds are set on the wedding band.  Other complementary options would be contrasted metals from the engagement ring, alternating shapes that will compliment the band, or perhaps a band that will trace along the curve of the ring itself.

    question: 'How can I match the two bands together?',
    answer:`
    Having the band-set match is something each couple can decide on.  Some examples of matching would be  engraving on the inside of the band, to matching the color of metals, or going with a designer such as Tacori where the side-profile offers crescent detailing.

    question: 'I do not want a matching band to my engagement ring, what can I do?',
    answer:`
    The wedding band will be the most worn ring of the two, as it will be necessary to take the engagement ring off when travelling or putting on gloves, etc.  The wearer will want to keep in mind what will
    compliment the center-stone and engagement ring the best with a different shank style such as twist or alternating diamonds.  We have seen a change of color such as rose gold with platinum being a really great compliment as well.
    Above all else, we want to not distract the center-stone, but rather compliment with creative styles.
