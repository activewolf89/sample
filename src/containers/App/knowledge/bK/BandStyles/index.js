      Eternity bands are diamonds or gemstones going all the way around the band.  Wearers that want this style do not want any metal to be seen when the band inevitably rotates, and is one of the most common choices we do.  one of the setbacks of this style is
      needing to size the band can be tricky.  It is best to be preemptive by ordering/making the band in a slightly larger size, adding a shim/spring to it, and taking it out once the finger gets larger since that is most often the direction hands take!

    description:`
      Three-quarters gives the look of eternity, with much less chances of seeing the metal from the opposite side of the band.  There is space to size the ring, and is a great choice for those that are planning on needing a size-up in the future.  For anything other than eternity,
      bands can be soldered together so there will always be a top and bottom, but for eternity it is not recommended due to diamonds getting worn over-time on the bottom of the shank.

    description:`
      Half-way designs offer flexibility for sizing and for the top-profile look to match closely with the engagement ring.  The only caveat of deciding to go half-way is knowing if your finger-size is biggest on the knuckle or tissue at the end of the finger.  This difference depends on how likely
      the ring will spin, as a ring sized for more knuckle will most likely spin more.

      Styles going 1/4 of the way around with diamonds are typically seen with matching engagement-ring.  In this example we have a tracer-band that compliments the center of the accompanying engagement ring.

      Plain bands are an excellent way to focus on the metal-work or simple elegance of the band itself.  In the example we have displayed, it is a plain yellow-gold band that has been etched with perpendicular lines giving nice texture.  Other opportunities for plain bands can be a travel band, or a
      stacking band that can give color between two white shanks.

      Three-stone bands are normally seen as right-hand bands, or standalong engagement rings that mark three-years.  Any size of stones can be done with the three-stone design, in this example we have all three diamonds full-bezel-set allowing for the focus to be on the number of stones.
