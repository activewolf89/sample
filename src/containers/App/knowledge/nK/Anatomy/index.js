      The necklace can be separated into the chain itself and the pendant.  For purposes on shopping our jewelry, we have set a pendant with every chain, however any pendant or chain can be swapped out for a different
      color or different width.  In this example we have highlighted selecting what type of chain, the mounting, and options with keeping the pendant attached to the chain.

      {title:'Center Stone',
      description:`
        The stone in this example is the focus of the pendant -- a deep blue topaz that compliments the surrounding yellow-gold mounting very well.  Necklaces are often done with the center-stone in focus, due to the pendant sitting at the center of the
        body, the stone draws a viewer or the wearer in and compliments their style.
      `
    },
      {title:'Mounting',
      description:`
        The mounting itself often compliments the center-stone and can greatly determine what overall look you want to portray.  A vintaage style with small diamonds and metal-work looks quite a bit different than a classic stud.  With smaller stones especially colored stones,
        it is normal to have a small halo of diamonds around the center-stone.  The reason for this is diamonds produce high light return, and to frame color provides a  beautiful partner to the center-stone.
      `
    },
    {title:'Jump Ring',
    description:`
    Determing whether you want the pendant to be interchangable, fashioned completely on the chain, or to have the pendant drop is largely dependant on style.  In this exmaple, two jump-rings are
    set on the 11:00/3:00 position to create balance and not have the pendant twist.  In this example we could have also created a removable bail so the chain can be reused with multiple styles.
    `
  },
  {title:'Chain',
  description:`
    There is a multitude of chains, and there are many reasons certain chains work better than others when it comes to the pendant you pick out.  The cable chain which is used in this example is
    extremely popular because it does not kink, is quite strong, can be done in any thickness/width, and will not curve to keep the pendant sitting more like a V-Shaped on the neck rather than U-Shaped.
