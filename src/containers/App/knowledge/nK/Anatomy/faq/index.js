    question: 'Can I set my existing stone in a pendant? ',
    answer: `
      Diamonds or gemstones make an excellent center-stone for a pendant, and is quite common for a single-side of a lost earring to be made into a pendant.

    question: 'How long should the chain be?',
    answer:`
    Chains vary from 14" and upward, and can be worn double.  It depends how far the neck you want the pendant to drop, neck thickness, and style-- 16 - 18" is the most standard range for single-strand necklaces.

    question: 'I want to interchange my pendant freely with the chain, how can I make this happen?',
    answer:`
      We would want to create a bail connected to the pendant with an opening large enough for a chain to go through -- at least 3MM in width.  This allows for the jump-ring to go through and ability for the pendant to be interchanged on the chain.
