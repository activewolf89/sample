    question: 'What styles are out there?',
    answer: `
    Similar to the earring, pendants can be stud-based with one stone held in place on the pendant, and the chain holding the pendant, or dangled which allows for more creative freedoms in the pendant.

    question: 'Can we custom-make a necklace based off a photo?',
    answer:`
    Yes, a picture is worth a thousand words! We can create a wax or order in the individual parts to create the pendant you are looking for.  If the design needs to be made with a CAD image, we can create this, and show you an assortment of chains that will best go with the pendant.
