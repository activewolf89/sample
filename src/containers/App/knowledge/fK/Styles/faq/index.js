    question: 'What styles are out there?',
    answer: `
    L T Denny represents designers as well as possess the ability to custom-make rings.  Essentially anything that can be made with a wax/cast and set can be made from a style, and is often easiest with a picture sent with the desired piece.  Most often we see rings made with diamonds/gemstones in a precious metal.

    question: 'Can we reuse our gold to make a new ring?',
    answer:`
    While fine rings can be made with existing material, it is recommended that casting-grade material is used over existing pieces, as issues such as porosity is avoided.  That being said, if there is personal attachment to the material, it can be done.
