      Diamond Fashion Rings are different than Engagement Rings in that they are typically larger than engagement rings, are worn on any finger, and can be stacked with multiple groupings of rings.
      That being said, any ring can be made and represented for engagement purposes or just for fashion.  For the example ring we have a cluster silver band from Tacori with crescent-detail which can be grouped together with
      other bands.

    description:`
      Gemstone fashion rings are the most common style for this category, as colored stones that may be too soft to be worn daily can be set in these settings.
      Since these rings can be worn with larger stones and less often, you can do really beautiful designs such as this amethyst with small diamonds around the center-stone.
      It is a common theme to see small diamonds around any colored stone, and is recommended to highlight the depth of color.

      Plain bands can focus on the texture and design of the metal itself.  In this example we have groupings of bubble-like sections set together, with vented design on the inside with millgraining around the setting.

      Pearl rings are not as common as pearl necklaces and earrings, however your pearl collection can be rounded out with a nice pearl fashion ring! Pearls are softer than most stones we recommend for center-rings, and should be taken
      with care when worn.  Any lotion, hair-spray, or heat should be avoided when working with pearls.
