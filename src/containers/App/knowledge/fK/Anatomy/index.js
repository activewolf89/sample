      Fashion/Fine rings share the same characteristics of wedding bands and engagement rings, however more colored stones are used with an emphasis on fun/casual wear to adorn the right hand.
      Larger bands compliment the middle finger, while smaller fashion rings can be stacked together to form beautiful collections.

      description:`
        Fashion Rings do not necessarily have to focus on a center-stone, but rather an overall look.  For this example, we have a Simon G twisted band, with a beautiful emerald-pear surrounded by
        a halo of diamonds.  On the opposite side of the pear we have diamonds that gives the ring a "shooting star" feel.

      {title:'Thickness',
      description:`
        The band thickness is similar to other rings, which will make the wearer able to feel the band on adjacent fingers.  The wider the band does not necessarily mean the thicker the ring, most rings
        we stock will not have issues with feeling too thick on the finger.
      `
    },
    {title:'Width',
    description:`
      Fashion Rings should be chosen knowing if you want to group the bands together in a stacking formation, or like the example, worn solo to take up the entire finger-joint, which means there is no
      set MM range.  General ball-park range for total width could be anywhere between 3 - 8MM as these rings will not be worn daily.
