    question: 'What are stacking rings, and how can I make my set into one?',
    answer: `
      Stackables are groupings of fashion rings that sit flush with one another, allowing for personalization in the stack.  If you have any gold or diamonds you no longer wear, we can create a stackable collection for you.

    question: 'The bigger the stone  the better, what are these rings called and what should I look out for?',
    answer:`
    Cocktail rings are traditionally worn on the right-hand, and are made to impress a style and appearance.  However, these rings are traditionally made with softer stones, and care has to be made such as with Amethysts in order for
    chances of chipping or damaging the stone.  They can be polished or recut, however if something does happen.

    question: ` Can groupings of rings be soldered together? `,
    answer:`
      Rings can be soldered together to form a multi-strand design, in this example we have a grouping of three rings made into a beautiful emerald-cut design from Simon G.
