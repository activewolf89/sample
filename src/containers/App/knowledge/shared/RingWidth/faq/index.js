    question: 'I like rings with as thin as possible, how thin can I go?',
    answer: `
      1.4MM is one of the thinnest widths, as anything thinner will compromise durability.  We often see thin bands tapering upwards to 1.8MM in this style show-casing the center-stone off.  However, it should be noted the ring should fit one’s lifestyle the best; a thicker ring will always be a sturdier ring.

    question: 'For my wedding-band, what range of width should I be looking for?',
    answer:`
      For ladies that are matching their engagement rings, simply measure the base of the engagement ring to match the wedding band.  For gent’s, it varies between 4 – 8MM depending on the first part of the finger the ring will rest on.  Anything larger than this may be uncomfortable to wear.
