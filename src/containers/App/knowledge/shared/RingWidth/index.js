      The width of jewelry may vary depending on how the jeweler measures.  For our measurements, we take the base of the piece such as a ring, and measure in millimeters with a leverage gauge.  If a ring tapers, one should imagine what it’ll look like on the finger with the widest part taken in consideration.  Width plays a major role in what the style looks like on the wearer and is dependent on the situation.   For example, if a person has large hands, they may be able to wear thicker rings, while someone with an engagement ring may have to match the width of the wedding-band to the engagement ring for a matching style.

    detail: `
      The wider the base of the shank is, the harder it will be to get the ring out-of-round.  It is quite common in today’s popularity of thinner rings to bend the band especially if platinum.  We suggest taking the rings off with anything that may damage the ring itself such as doing dishes, working out or climbing for example.
