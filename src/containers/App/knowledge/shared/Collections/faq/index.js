    question: 'I do not see a style from a collection of a designer, how can I see it in person?',
    answer: `
      Almost all items seen on designer websites or in a store can be memo'd to us if we represent the brand.  Some designers have 1000's of items as SKU's, and for us we want to display to our customer exactly
      what we have in-store at this very time.  If you have need anything that we do not have, we can always get it in, just let us know.

    question: 'Can collections be modified to fit my individual need',
    answer:`
      The answer is yes and no.  Depending on which designer you are looking at, and what you are requesting, we will have to see.  Often-times new designs come out because of this very question, and it is exciting for us
      to find the answer for you and guide you through the process.  Tacori is a great example of a designer who takes two styles and blends them together into a unique look for our customers.
