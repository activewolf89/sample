    	White metals are one of the most classic colors for jewelry, as colorless tends to match with any clothing, hair color, or style.  Different metals will show different shades of white; platinum for instance is the whitest white of any of the metals, while white-gold is has the warmest undertones as it’s a mixed metal.

      Yellow metal is attributed to the rich color of gold; a luster that has been used in jewelry for its malleability, rarity, and beauty.  The higher amount of gold will directly correlate to the intensity of this color, but for all practical purposes the jewelry industry uses 14K/18K as the two options.  It should be noted that any ring can be done in any gold combination, however the higher gold the jewelry is made, the softer the piece is and more susceptible to damage.

      Rose metal is a vibrant red-gold that is attributed to the amount of copper mixed with gold.  The higher amount of copper means less gold which will make the piece look redder.  We often see rose as a great alternative to the white-metals, contrasting well with platinum.
