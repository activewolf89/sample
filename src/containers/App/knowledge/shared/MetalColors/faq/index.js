    question: 'I heard white-gold needs to get re-rhodium plated every so often, is this true?  ',
    answer: `
      White-gold is typically palladium or nickel mixed with gold, and then dipped with Rhodium.  Depending on the amount of wear the ring gets(most often seen as the bottom of the shank) the ring will start getting more yellow at those areas.  Depending on how bothered the wearer is at this, it may need to get re-dipped every 3 – 5 years.

    question:'I have an allergic reaction to nickle, does L T Denny use nickel in their white-gold?',
    answer:`
      No, we do not use any nickel with our custom-made rings and any designer we work with.  We will typically use Palladium as an alternative for its hypoallergenic properties.

    question:'Does rose-gold or yellow-gold have to be re-plated?' ,
    answer:`
      Neither of these metals need to be re-plated as the color is throughout the piece.

    question:'Can jewelry be polished to be less shiny?' ,
    answer:`
      Often-times we will brush the metal such as a men’s band to be less shiny, which is just a systematic way of scratching the ring to give an appearance.  There are many different styles of polish and can change the look and keep the ring looking new longer.

    question:'I like the look of black rings, but I heard they may not be able to last me my lifetime?' ,
    answer:`
      There are no precious-metals that are black in nature, which means that these rings do not respond to heat and reforming the same way as gold or platinum does.  Tungsten is an example of a metal that can actually shatter if dropped, while Titanium cannot be cut by a jeweler and re-sized.  That being said, Tantalum is a dark non-precious metal with a comfort-fit lining on the inside that we have been working with, and it can be stretched up or condensed down one-size.
