    question: 'White-gold vs Platinum – what’s the difference?',
    answer:`
          White-gold is yellow mixed with a white metal and often plated to make it whiter with Rhodium.  The rhodium over time(mainly the bottom of the rings) wear away over-time and the yellow of the metal starts to show through.  White-gold is a hard material, meaning it will show less scratches but will also have to be re-tipped for prongs because the metal wears away the tiny prongs that hold the stones.  Platinum is a natural element on the periodic table, it does not change color, and holds diamonds and gemstones the best out of any metal; however to show less scratches white-gold is often preferred.

    question: 'Rose-gold – is it just trendy?',
    answer:`
    Rose-gold, along with all the other metals, go through cycles of popularity that depends mainly upon influences from all our surroundings.  For the most part, the metal choice should reflect the wearer and what they like the best over feeling like one is just trending or another – this is a life-time piece and trends go in and out of fashion.
