      Platinum is a rare, white, precious metal that is found in few areas of the world and in limited quantity. It is the whitest of the white-metals and is very strong, allowing for jewelry to be worn daily with less chance of a stone coming loose. The metal is also able to be re-formed over-time, allowing for the metal to be worn three times longer than white-gold. Platinum is also softer than most other precious metals, but with this softness comes easier repairs and maintenance over time. Among the many other positive features, the heavier weight of the platinum gives a preferable substance to engagement ring selections. Any piece of jewelry can be done with any precious metal, however for the wearer with a more active and hectic lifestyle, platinum is the highly recommended.

          Searching for a ladies band first comes down to if you want to match the existing engagement ring metal.  Partial reason for this is not distracting from the center-stone, and metals wearing the same over-time.  However we often swap colors out to get a desired look, as well as stacking multiple colors together!

        Platinum is softer and is often one of the highest chances of scratching; this affect is called Platina.  Some guys prefer the look of scratched metal, however for those that do not, the metal is very easy to repolish if need be.  The other trait to note is platinum is a dense metal, and will be heavier than most other choices.

    Palladium, similar to Platinum, is a rare, white, precious metal that is found in few areas of the world and in limited quantity. Palladium is a dark-white-metal, and is very strong, with the same properties that platinum has. We typically see this metal done with gentâ€™s bands, as the lightness of the metal offsets added metal for a wider width. As of 2019 the price of palladium has gone up exponentially while platinum which has dropped, creating an increasingly lower visibility of palladium in the market. If the wearer is interested in the lightest ring on the market with high durability however, palladium is hard to beat.

    White-gold rose in popularity as an alternative to platinum for many types of jewelry.  It is a hard material, which shows less scratches than platinum, and is a warmer white due to the amount of gold in the alloy.  White-gold is a ratio of 24K gold, with the amount of white being how much white-metals are mixed with the yellow, generally being 14K(58.5%) or 18K(75%) yellow; which means the higher karat the warmer the color will be.
    What makes gold white is typically palladium or nickel, with the latter being hyperallergenic for many.  We typically suggest if going the route of white-gold to always ask what alloy it is mixed with, as we use Palladium as a mixture and is the standard for many ring designers.
