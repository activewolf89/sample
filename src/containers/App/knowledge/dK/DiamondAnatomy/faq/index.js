    question: 'Can diamonds be damaged? ',
    answer:`
      Yes, diamonds grow deep within the earth billions of years ago with specific cleavage angles.  The mounting is there to protect the cleavage angles, however in some settings such as tension-set or semi-bezel, they expose the sides of the diamond for look.  This has the negative side-effect of exposing the diamond to chips and damage over-time.
