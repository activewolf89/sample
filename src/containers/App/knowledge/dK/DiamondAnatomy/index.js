    The diamond over 100's of years has gone through different iterations of cutting to produce what we see today as brilliant-cuts.  The diamond itself is simple in make-up as its entirely made of carbon, however with carbon structured in a way
    to produce the hardest material on earth.  A scale called the Moh's scale which ranks 1-10 hardest materials, diamonds being the hardest, is exponentially harder than a 9.  With this hardness, diamond-cutters can polish these stones and shape them to produce
    extrodinary light-return, reaching upwards of 99% if cut appropriately and is the right shape.

    description:`The table is the largest smooth space on the top-profile of the diamond allowing the highest amount of unbroken white-light.  A lot of what makes a diamond sparkle and beautiful is dependant on the correct proportions
    that go through the table, and is dependant on stone shape.  To give an example, a round we generally look for between a 55-57% table`,

    description:`Crown angles are going to be the slope from the girdle that creates the breaking down of white-light into various colors that the viewer enjoys in the diamond such as oranges and blues that comes through.  Angles that are too high/low in this angle
    will not allow light entering through the diamond prism to reflect properly back.  A good rule of thumb for rounds is to look for a 34 - 35 crown angle.

      description:`Girdle is the line that separates the top and bottom of a diamond, and can come in a variety of thicknesses.  A girdle too shallow will cause the setter to have issues with setting the stone and issues with longevity such as chipping.  A girdle too thick
      masks the stones weight by placing too much dispersed size in the girdle.

    description:`
    The pavillion and its associated angles are the lower half of the diamond, and interplays with the top-half of the stone to provide brilliancy and ensures light comes back through the top of the stone rather than escape through the bottom.

  The culet is where all the pavillion angles come together to form a small pointer in the center.  Modern brilliant-cuts will have a culet, but there are times when the culet is missing and is polished at the bottom.
