    Diamonds are found in certain areas of the world, primarily Russia, Canada, and Africa.  When sourcing diamonds, countries that benefit from an increase amount of capital also have issues with funding war with the money from diamonds
    outside of the pipeline.  There is a general guideline that has occured from this called The Kimberley Process, which states to the importers that are bringing these diamonds into their countries that the diamond's they are getting are from
    non-conflict sourcing, however there is no very concrete evidence of this.  We at our store have aligned ourselves with a diamond called The Forevermark diamond, which tracks via the inscription number inscribed in the center of the diamond, the journey of the diamond
    from the mind to the eventual wearer of the diamond that the stone comes from non conflict areas.  On top of this, Botswana the coutnry of Africa owns about 20% of DeBeers, which in their joint effort gives back to their community building school and has lifted the population of Botswana in the past 10-20 years.

    Just like connections made through our jewelry designers, our diamond suppliers are carefully selected ensuring that the stones we receive align ourselves with ethically sourcing and careful selection.  Throughout the trade, L T Denny Jewelers is known for
    being particularly picky with diamonds we carry and show our customers, in all honesty the cost of shipping diamonds back and forth is quite expensive, and when we need to get a diamond in for our customers, we really try to tailor what we are bringing in to reduce our costs and
    keep our prices as competitive as possible.  A few times a year we go to trade-shows and make new connections and cement our existing connections with our cutters to provide excellent quality for our customers.
