    question: 'How are natural diamonds produced?',
    answer:`
      	Diamonds are born out of condensed carbon deep within the earth’s crust over millions or billions of years, and through the extreme temperatures and pressures, this carbon condenses to form diamonds – which are then brought up in molton rock formations to the earths crust.

    question: 'How are man-made diamonds produced?',
    answer:`
    Lab created diamonds take a few weeks to make, and are done in a laboratory to mimic earth’s natural process of extreme heat or extreme pressure to form the stone, where a natural diamond may take millions of years these diamonds take a few weeks and are typically 25% less than the price of a natural diamond of the same quality.

    question: 'Can we get man-made diamonds, and what should I know about them?',
    answer:`
    The answer is yes, question is controversial in the fact that there are two sides to this argument – one being that natural diamonds are more expensive, but have maintained their value over an extended documented period of time, whereas man-made diamonds will only get less expensive over time, so the value of the purchase at this current time may degrade the value of the stone purchased as time goes on.
    Since the mainstream push of short-term sales for Man-made diamonds in engagement rings has been so prevelent in today's society, the question comes up quite a bit.  We want to stress that these stones are neither rare nor precious, and will adjust downwards as man-made diamonds become more and more prevalent.
