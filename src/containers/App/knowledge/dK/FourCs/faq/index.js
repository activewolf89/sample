    question: 'Cut ',
    answer: `
    Diamonds do not sparkle on their own, they require precise cutting, separate from the need to maximize the actual carat size of the stone.
    The cut may be the hardest component to decipher between the different C's, mainly because it takes knowledge of cut angles and what shape
    the stone itself will eventually be cut into.  We specialize in the cut factor, and walk through our customers as much as possible to explain why
    certain stones sparkle more than others.

    question: 'Color',
    answer:`
    The color of a diamond is typically based off the amount of Nitrogen in the stone and casts a yellow tint to the stone.  GIA standardized the color spectrum of D – Z we use today, and ranges from colorless D – F, near colorless G – I, and onwards down to intense and fancy yellows.  We primarily try to stick within the F – J range when looking at engagement ring quality diamonds and warmer colors for accent stones such as studs.

    question: 'Clarity',
    answer:`
    Clarity ranges from IF – I2 and like color, has a sweet spot to look for.  In terms of a definition, inclusions or blemishes within or on top of the stone can come in any size, color and shape.

    question: 'Carat',
    answer:`
    Diamond carat is the measurement of how heavy a diamond weighs.  The metric “carat” is 200 milligrams, and can be often described as points if you are talking about weight below that.

    question: 'What is the biggest jump in price besides carat?',
    answer:`
    Color, excluding the Carat(weight) of the stone, is the biggest jump in price and is often overbought when it comes to picking out the center-stone.  Since color is so dependent in the eyes of the wearer, we try to find the sweet spot where you barely stop noticing the color and stop there because anything more and the purchaser is sacrificing a budget to something that will not be noticed.
