      The color range standard we communicate is often GIA's system of D - Z.  When looking at diamond color, it is often communicated through the amount of yellow in the stone because Nitrogen is the most common trace element in Natural Diamond.  Color can go beyond Z, and is considered Fancy color at that point.  The image shown is our master stone set ranging from E to M(left to right).

      Carat is the weight of the diamond ranging from .01 carat and onwards.  The weight of one carat is .20 grams, and is the size of the stone.  The actual appearance of the profile of the stone varies depending on how its cut.  In the example, we have glass cut from FireCushion vs a standard cushion, showing that the same size stone can look 15% larger if cut with different proportions.

    description: `
      Cut may be the most important aspect of a diamond, and is often the most overlooked characteristic of polished diamonds.  The reason for this is it involves the most education on the interplay of light entering the diamond and how the critical angles affect light leaving the stone back into the viewers eyes.  Diamond cut refers to the shape of the stone(any shape can be cut with a diamond), and
      light return the diamond has.  We spend a lot of time educating our customers and often bring them outside to see unbroken white light as opposed to the light of the store.  The example image is an example of hearts and arrows, a japanese technique to achieve the perfect cut for rounds.

    description: `
      Clarity is the internal grading of a diamond ranging from Flawless to I2.  As diamonds are formed under the earths crust billions of years ago, host rock, fractures, and smaller diamonds can mix with the carbon creating a unique finger-print for the diamond.
      Inclusions are a large topic of discussion, but for the most part we strive to buy diamonds for our store around SI range, cherry picking stones for inclusions you cannot see without aid such as a 10x power loupe.
