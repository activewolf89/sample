    question: 'What laboratories do we recommend? ',
    answer: `
    -	Recommended laboratories to work with are GIA, AGS, and Forevermark.  GIA is the most common, and any diamond will get graded if sent to GIA â€“ everything else regarded in the trade is seen as graded too easy and is meant to obsure the true nature of the diamond being graded.

    question: 'Should I just trust the certificate from GIA?',
    answer:`
    GIA created the standard for diamond grading, however GIA grades any diamond sent to them and get paid per diamond they grade. If they offer less harsh grades, more diamonds will get sent to them for evaluation.
    You should always examine a diamond in person before making a decision to buy, or should trust with 100% confidence the diamond expert who you purhcase from.

    question: 'What is the most common spec overlooked on a cert?',
    answer:`
      We represent online companies that have their customers come into the store to pick up their diamond selection, and probably the biggest missed spec is fluorescence.  Sometimes this trait is actually good for the stone, as lower colors such as J/K will look whiter with strong blue.  However, for higher colors it will make the stone look foggier in appearance, and
      should have more research applied.
