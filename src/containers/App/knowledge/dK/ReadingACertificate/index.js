      After GIA standardized the system for grading loose diamonds it gave the consumer,retailers, and cutters a way to have conversations on what a diamond is like based off reading the certificate a GIA gemologist provided.
      However to note, GIA are comprised of people, with different opinions on what constitues a certain color,clarity and make-up.  It is often left to the retailer/consumer to know what they are getting by using the certificate and their trained eye, as there
      is a big range for each classification such as clarity SI.  At L T Denny, we strive to use our experience and select beautiful SI's that are scrutinized until the stones we select have inclusions that cannot be seen by the naked eye.

  {title:'Grading Results',
  description:`
    This section on the cert typically breaks the stone down into the four categories of Carat Weight, Color Grade, Clarity Grade, and Cut Grade.  Carat weight is the most objective as it is literally a measurement of a stones weight, however the other three especially Cut Grade
    are more subjective in their approach and multiple GIA graders are used with a final grader to give the final pass.

{title:'Additional Grading Information',
description: `
  Polish and Symmetry go into the Cut grade of the stone, and often-times a stone called Triple Ex has a GIA cut grade of Excellent across all three categories.  Fluorescence is the amount of trace elements in the stone that, when exposes to ultra-violet light displays typically a
  variation of blue; it's range is from None to Strong Blue.  Comments within the cert will explain further where the inclusions are, and of what nature in order to provide the owner of the stone more information on what they may expect when using a 10x power loupe.
`

{title:'GIA Number',
description:`
  The GIA report is a series of numbers normally inscribed on the girdle of the diamond(however it is not always 100% the case), and is used to lookup and identify the diamond.  You cannot see this number without aid, and is inscribed by lazer.
`
},
{title:'Proportions',
description:`
  Proportions are objective measurements taken by machine to provide percentages and information so that the Cut grade can be understood much more in-depth.
`
},
{title:'Clarity Characteristics',
description:`
  This section allows for mapping of inclusions and surface blemishes for further analysis, and is a very useful tool before getting a diamond from our cutter to show one of our customers.

summary: `
  Reading diamond certificates takes time, and above all else experience in knowing that none of these section individually tells the story of how beautiful a diamond will be.  In tandem, and being able to see the stone for yourself in
  unbroken white-light is the only way to really know what you are purchasing, and is how we source each stone as we cherry pick the best of categories for our stock in-store and when we go search for our customers the 1000s of stones on the market.
