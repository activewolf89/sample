      Diamond bracelets can be worn daily and stacked to produce beautiful layers.  The example is a flex-bangle design with stainless steel on the inside, wrapped with 18K white-gold.
      THese bracelets can range from traditional tennis bracelets to more modern designs where the wearer can put their bracelet on much faster and easier than with clasps.
