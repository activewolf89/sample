    answer:`
    Tennis bracelets are typically gemstone/diamond bracelets that are chained together to contour the wrist.  While they are easy to wear, the term Tennis is not necessary to wear while playing, it became called a Tennis bracelet because a pro Tennis player lost here bracelet during a match in the 1980â€™s.

    question: 'What are the characteristics of a Flex Bracelet?',
    answer:`
    A flex bracelet is stainless steel wrapped in a precious metal such as rose/yellow/white metals.  They are a great alternative to the Tennis Bracelet because it does not change shape, and offers a beautiful mix between that and the bangle.  They are also the easiest to put on, as the wearer does not need to push their hand through, rather cuff onto the wrist.
