      Bracelets are a category of jewelry we have introduced to our clients that have their necklace and earring collection, but desire a fun alternative that can compliment any watch or ring-set.
      What to look out for in bracelets is length, ease-of-use, and overall design.

      description:`
        Bracelets can be designed with chain-links, solid metal such as bangles, set with diamonds in a tennis-bracelet fashion, or a flex-bangle design
        where stainless steel is wrapped in gold wire.  Whatever the design may be, pros and cons of ease-of-use and daily wear are typically thought of.

    description:`
    For our customers in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, being able to wear your jewelry daily is important.  For bracelets it is one of the harder pieces of jewelry to wear since
    the wearer needs to practice putting it on with one hand, or choosing an alternative that can be thrown on.  Some examples of this are flex-bangles like in the example, or a full-bangle
    where you can slip your hand through.

    description:`
      Bracelets are measured in inches and range between 5 - 9".  A straight-forward way of determining length of bracelet can be to take a soft measuring tape and take the circumference
      around the wrist, and add enough slack to let the bracelet drape slightly.  Other factors that should be taken when determining length are how the bracelet clasps, and shape of bracelet since
      some bracelets will be oval-shaped to sit easier on the wrist if inflexible.
