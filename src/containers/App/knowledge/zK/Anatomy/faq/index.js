    question: `
      I am worried my bracelet may come off, how can it be reinforced?
    `,
    answer: `
    Safety chains are a chain of metal links fashioned with a lobster clasp onto a loop â€” they are quite useful in securing the bracelet and is a case-by-case basis where the wearer may feel more comfortable wearing them.  The only trade-off to them is the fact that they require a little extra time to put on, but can be put on any open-ended flex bracelet or bangle.

    question: 'I have a hard time putting on bracelets, what adjustments can be made to an existing piece to make it easier?',
    answer:`
    Bracelets can be modified to have the lobster clasp enlarged, we can also look into creating a new clasp as well.  It is interesting that bracelets have so many different variations to close the clasp, it is probably the most pronounced out of any category of jewelry.

    question: 'My Wrist got larger, can the bracelet be made bigger?',
    answer:`
      Similar to engagement rings, bracelets can be enlarged by adding more metal to the bangle, or adding more diamonds to the piece itself.  Create a email ticket with us and send us a picture and we would be happy to see what can be done.
