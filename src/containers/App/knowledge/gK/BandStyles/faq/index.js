    question: 'What styles are out there?',
    answer: `
      There are plenty of characteristics a gent's band can possess, and depending on if your hand is more knuckle-heavy or straight depends on a flat-profile or semi-rounded profile will look best.
      We have an eye for what ring-style will look best on your hand, and would be happy to have you come in so we can look at your hand and make suggestions, or just get a text and we will be happy to text back suggestions as well.

    question: 'How should I go about picking the style that is right for me?',
    answer:`
    The question you have to ask yourself is, do I want this ring forever or am I okay with replacing the ring every now and then? If the answer is I want it forever, going with a precious metal band with a finish that fits your style is the way to go.  If
    you are okay with having a band that may need replacing every 10-15 years then go with a non-precious metal and if when the time comes to adjust your ring size we would just order a new one.

    question: 'I like dark colors, what options do we have for this?',
    answer:`
      Tantalum is probably the best match for dark colors as it can be sizable, scratch resistent, naturally dark heavy material, and can be made with any finish.  There are issues with titanium, tungsten, rubber-rings, and other dark materials
      that will stop from having your band forever.
