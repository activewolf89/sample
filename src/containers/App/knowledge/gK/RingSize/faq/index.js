    question: 'Can my mens-band be resized?',
    answer: `
      If the metal is a precious metal, or a precious-metal that is soldered to conjoin the ring, then yes it can be sized.  If a non-precious metal(excluding tantlum by up to one size), the no the ring cannot be resized since cutting into the ring
      will not be able to resize.

    question: 'How long does it take to get a ring re-sized?',
    answer:`
    A gents band can be resized with a condensor and expander up to 2-sizes same-day.  Other than that, we can cut into a precious metal rings and add or take away metal , and lazer solder back taking a one-day turn around.
