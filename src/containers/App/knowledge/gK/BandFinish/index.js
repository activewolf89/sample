    Polished is probably the most iconic gent's band finish, and can be done with a high polish as well to create different effects.  Polish can be applied to any ring, however all rings if worn overtime eventually turn into more of a matte finish.

    description:`
      Matte finish is structured scratching, where the goldsmith brushes the metal in a certain direction to create a subtle look and less shiny version of the ring itself.  It is easier to put a matte finish on a polished ring, but harder the other way around as the metal gets grinded away to produce that effect.

      Hammered design is one of the hardest materials to show scratches as the mixed patterning can really mask any blemishes that eventually happens with rings.  The depth of hammer can also be adjusted depending on the wearer's preferences, just let us know how deep or how wide the hammered needs to be and we can make/order rings
      of that nature.

    Mixed finishes creates pattern and texture to the ring itself, often-times we see this with matte in places and polished in other areas.  In this example we have polished lines going down a matte band.

      Any texture on the band itself such as the engraving/keltic knots done on the sample band can be found in our Textured Finish section.  We can engrave on the outside for a beautiful design, or selecting meteorite bands will give a nice grainy texture to the inlay.

      Wirebrush is a form of textured finish, however like hammered it is unique in the sense that the lines are noticable whereas a matte finish will be much more uniform and mask the pattern.
