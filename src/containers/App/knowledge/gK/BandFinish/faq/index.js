    question: 'What are the different types of finishes?',
    answer: `
    There is actually quite a bit of variations for gent's band finish, however the range goes from high polish to matte and everything else falls inbetween the two.  you can get textured designs such as
    hammered-style, brushed, wirebrushed, and different variations of those.

    question: 'Can any finish we applied to my band?',
    answer:`
    Yes, a finish is just a certain brush stroke applied to the band.  It is noted that a finish will wear away the band, so it is important to note to not reapply a finish too often.

    question: 'What will show scratches least?',
    answer:`
      A matte finish, with a subdued look will show scratches least, as the brushed finish is actually uniform scratches applied to the band itself.
