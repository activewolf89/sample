      Gents bands have the benefit and drawback of being able to choose the band without any relavence to another ring such as an engagement ring -- allowing for more freedom and choices to select from.  This selection tends to
      follow more classic styles, but with a focus on the interior and how it feels when wearing the band.

      description:`
      The inside of the band is semi-rounded in the example provided, giving the ability for fingers to have a space to escape if hot, salt intake was high the night before, or if hands are getting bigger.  The majority of
      our bands we carry are comfort-fit, but to know for sure looking on the 360 shots of our rings you will notice the edges easing if comfort-fit.

      {title:'Width',
      description:`
        Width for men's bands ranges from 3MM - 8MM, with anything greater than 8MM being too wide for most fingers, and less than 3MM having a higher chance of getting out-of-round.  The average we tend to see is 6MM, and inbetween widths can be done
        such as 6.5,5,5,4.5.

    {title:'Thickness',
    description:`Thickness is one of the traits that goes unnoticed when trying to find the perfect fit.  A general rule of thumb is you should not feel pressure between your two other fingers.  If the ring is too thick you will start noticing the thickness.
    `

  {title:'Finish',
  description:`
    Gent's band finishes come in a variety of finishes with polished or matte being the most common.  In the example we have meteorite, which is a natural matte finish that gives a textured feel and look to the ring itself.  Often-times polished will
    turn over-time into more of a matte finish due to scratching from wear-and-tear.  Any finish can be done to any ring, we have a goldsmith on-site that can change a finish to whatever you wish or re-add later.
