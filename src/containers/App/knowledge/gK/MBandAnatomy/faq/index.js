    question: 'What is the most important aspect of a gents band? ',
    answer: `
      Men's bands are typically wider and thicker than other rings, and with this thickness we want to avoid any straight interiors.  The reason for this is, if you have a beer, something salty, or its hot you do not want the ring to be
      cutting into your hand.  It is important to look at each ring at the interior and notice any easing of the edges.

    question: 'Can finishes be applied to any gents band?',
    answer:`
    Any finish can be applied to any wedding band.  The most common will be polish, however everything gets worn over-time into more of a matte finish.

    question: 'What width will look best on my finger?',
    answer:`
    The general width we start is a 6MM, however depending on how thick your finger is and long it is more of an art to know what the correct width is.  Overall use your eye and feeling to know, however do not go too wide or
    it'll be uncomfortable
