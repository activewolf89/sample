    question: 'Why should I consider side-profile?',
    answer:`

    Side-profile is the most common perspective you and others will have on your ring.  For example, driving in the car you will notice the side-perspective, and depending on how high your stone sits may be dependant on if you
    decide to get side-profile design as well.  It all really comes down to preference and in some ways an objective eye on what best fits one's finger.
