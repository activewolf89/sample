    description:'The engagement ring can be surprisingly complex when trying to understand what the wearer may like about a ring compared to another.  The introduction of this section describes general lingo and terms in order to speak the language of the engagement ring, and hopefully better understand what you love about a feature or what you may want to change.  Rings are broken down in how the  top-profile of the ring is in appearance, however attention to what others may see in the side-profile and subsequent width and thickness should be taken into consideration as well.',

    description:'The top profile is the look when the wearer sees the ring straight down their finger; it is the general outline the ring makes with the inter-relationship of the finger.  The Center-Stone is the center of attention, with center-shape and ring styleâ€™s either complimenting the center, or incorporating the center representing the entire piece.  The foundation pertains to the bottom-half of the ring, which allows for further customization and opportunities for diamonds to be set.  In this example, we see the top-profile to be pave-set diamonds inter-weaving the center-stone in a ribbon-like fashion.',

    description:'The side profile is typically attributed to how the ring looks when seen at eye-level and is important for the overall height of the ring and what yourself and others see quite often.  A beautiful side-profile such as this example is a design by Tacori, highlights crescent-detail; a thicker shank allows the designer to create creative and beautiful masterworks.  The Metal Stamp is most often always place on the inside-shank allows for quick identification for jewelers when work is done for the ring such as sizing or repairing.  ',
