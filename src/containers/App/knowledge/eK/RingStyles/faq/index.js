    question: 'What styles are out there?',
    answer: `
    There are plenty of different styles to consider from solitaire being one center-stone with a plain-band or diamonds, to a halo(with small diamonds around the center-stone in certain sizes).  Any engagement ring being considered should be seen with what a potential wedding band would look like in order for the two bands to blend as best as possible.   The best step towards finding the style is just to look through the rings/pictures you have and see what would work best.

    question: 'What If I don’t know the style?',
    answer:`
    The easiest and safest way to propose is with a simple solitaire setting, set with a diamond from us – we charge $150 for a 14K simple solitaire and set it with any diamond you select from us.  Once you propose, you can leave the ring as-is and it would last a life-time, or we can take the stone out of the center and set it into a more permanent mounting and credit you back the amount.
