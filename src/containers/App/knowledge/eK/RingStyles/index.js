    description:`
      Solitaire engagement rings are the most classic style of ring; plain down the sides, with the diamond center-stone as the focal point. Nevertheless, there is quite a variety within this style that show-cases it’s simple setting. Changing the number-of-prongs, finger spacing, shank or setting thickness, and other such subtleties can enhance the simple beauty of the solitaire without sacrificing its simplicity. We see this style chosen most often when the wearer desires the center-stone to be their focal point, and/or when they wish to signify the difference between the engagement ring and marriage band with a contrast in ring styles. The wearer who will love this style is looking for a confident show-stopper they can wear day in and day out.

    description:`
      Pave is French for paved with diamonds. This term is generally given to rings that have a solitaire appearance, but with stones going down the sides. Pave diamonds use tiny beads to hold the diamonds in place, and can be done in either a half-way, three-quarter, or eternity style. This style creates visual interest on the top and side-profile of the metal and allows the ring to sparkle even more than a simple center-stone. The type of diamond setting can be modified as well as the shape of the stones, with a baguette or round-shape as the most common shape.

    description:`
      Halo or Bloom, is a setting style that surrounds the center stone with smaller stones. Often these stones create the same outline as the center-stone, but they can also be done in different shapes and sizes. This style takes the focus away from the center-stone and showcases the entirety of ring instead, having the added effect of making the center stone appear larger than it really is. The stones can be set at the same height or lower than the center-stone (the lower style is often seen in Tacori’s Dantela Halo style). This style of ring is for the wearer who loves that extra shimmer and sparkle on their ring that can only be achieved by the fullness of a halo.

      Three-stone designs highlight the center-stone with two smaller-stones on either side in the same or complimentary shape. These can be customizable by mixing and matching other colored gemstones (sapphires, rubies, etc.) with the center-diamond or visa-versa and gives the piece a larger visual impact overall.

    description:`
    Vintage or ‘antique-style’ engagement rings are modern takes on past designs.  These pieces tend to overlap metal and diamonds in uniquely artistic patterns. The design itself offers a very personal and one-of-a-kind feel and often can be hand-carved per specification, as the smiths of such rings are often inspired by methods and artisanal intricacies from the past 80 years or more.
We commonly help customers remount their diamonds onto vintage/antique style rings to elevate their diamond in an elegant pattern. Oftentimes it’s reminiscence of art-deco design is highlighted as a key attraction. Its characteristic design can be found through the sellers Tacori and Beverley K who are well-known for using this style to show-case their pieces.
