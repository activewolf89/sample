      Cushion-shaped outlines are soft-squares, often being called pillow-like in shape as the corners are rounded off to provide a nice alternative to the round.  The shape is an excellent alternative to the round, and provides a fuller appearance to the overall center of the setting.  The outline can be found through using a cushion-shape diamond, or by creating a cushion-shaped halo.
