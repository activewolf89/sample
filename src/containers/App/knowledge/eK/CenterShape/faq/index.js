    question: `
    I like a style I found that has a round, but I want to make it for a cushion, can center-shapes be changed?
    `,
    answer: `
      Any item can be modified to change the center-shape, for your particular ring-size, and in what metal you desire.  Simply send us the link to the desired piece, and we can get a quote to create that ring with the modified center.

    question: 'When would a center-shape be undesirable for a particular setting?',
    answer:`

      Some settings such as engagement rings with halos need to have a certain shape in order to conform to the overall look.  If you took a princess-cut diamond and put a round halo around it, which we have done before, it masks the overall outline of the center-shape.
      If this is for example a remounting and you want a round shape but has a princess-cut diamond, that would make sense.  It all depends on the scenario.
