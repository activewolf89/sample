    Purchasing an engagement ring and what to budget, number one is what do you feel comfortable presenting, tailored to what she would expect in the ring.  The engagement ring/wedding process is comprised of three separate purchases:

  {title:'The engagement ring',
  description:'Many rings seen on websites or in store, unless they show a complete ring with center-diamond will only be for the ring itself.  The reason we do this is any of the setting seen can be special ordered, or set with a stock-piece of any size/shape of stone including stones outside diamond.  It is also important to not be forced to buy the center-stone if you like the setting, but want a different quality of center or perhaps another stone.  So in order to budget appropriately, the first step is to figure out, how much does the style she may like cost, and then back out the budget of the center-stone afterwards.'

{title:'The center-stone',
description: 'For purposes of this conversation, we will use the natural diamond; we explain further why natural diamonds are used in the industry in our diamond section found here.  A typical 1 carat runs around $4,000 â€“ $6,000 depending on many factors such as quality of cut, how yellow the stone is from nitrogen, inclusions born with the stone, and shape.  The price of stones goes up/down exponentially the bigger or smaller from this mark, and is often a good benchmark.'
},
{title:'Future Wedding Bands',
description:'It is always good to know when the wedding may be, and this is largely a separate topic however if the wedding is a year or less away, budgeting for the eventual two bands should be considered for this topic.'
},
],
summary: `In any kind of situation, we try to find what budget you may have in mind for the entire process, and stick strictly to that and guide you through the whole process.  It is often hard to put a number for the ring, but it helps narrow down what to present and search for.`
