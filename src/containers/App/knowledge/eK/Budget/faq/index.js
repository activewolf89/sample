    question: 'Are rings priced with a diamond center-stone?',
    answer: `
    A typical 1-carat seems to be the benchmark for a lot of purchases and serves as a classic example.
     On average a 1-carat round that has been vetted by a professional jeweler with moderate color/clarity can start around $4,500 and go on upwards â€“
     this is separate from the actual mounting.

    question: 'Why is the center-stone not included in the price of the mounting?',
    answer:`
      Selecting a center-stone is in itself a subject of a lot of research and time to know what you find important when choosing a diamond.  This is why we do not typically set diamonds in our mountings unless
      the diamond is a fancy shape such as an asscher or emerald.  We take the time to explain to you what to look for when selecitng a diamond, and marry the two once you find the perfect stone.

    question: 'Does L T Denny Jewelers do financing options',
    answer:`
    We work with an outside financing company called GE money, which typically does same-as-cash for six months and then the interest rate ticks up quite a bit.  We generally dot not suggest going through this route, but we are very flexible with
    layaway payments.  There have been a few cases where we worked well over two years before we received final payment.
