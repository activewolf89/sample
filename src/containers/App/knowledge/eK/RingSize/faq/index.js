    question: 'How do I get the right size?',
    answer: `
          The primary focus is to have the exact ring-size without spoiling the surprise. This ends up being a challenge in itself mainly due to the fact that there are a number of different fingers that one ring may be worn on, but generally when looking at a finger-size we look at the largest part of the finger first -- which will be most likely either the beginning of the knuckle or the end of the finger. A general rule of thumb is to try on a ring, and closely compare that with your own finger, and using this we can find the ring-size. Generally you would want to be a little bigger than smaller as the purpose is to wear the ring as a surprise and then can be sized down afterwards'

    question: 'What to do if the ring-size is off?',
    answer:`
    We generally try to be as proactive as possible to get the ring ring-size to begin with, but chances are that the exact measurement is not found, and fingers can fluctuate with weather, what was eaten the day of ,etc.  We have the option of sizing rings down recommended up to 2-sizes(up or down), after that the ring starts getting out of round, and most likely will be re-made.
