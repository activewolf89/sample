    question: 'Can my center-stone be set lower in the prongs than it is now or is seen in photo?',
    answer: `
      Yes, any stock sample is the highest the center-stone can be set, as it is easier taking metal away than adding metal.  We do not suggest going as low as humanly possible, as it becomes difficult to clean the center-stone, however we generally adjust height on preference and is no problem.

    question: 'Is there a requirement on number of prongs depending on center-shape?',
    answer:`

There is often no requirements for prongs to center-stone, however what may look best and secure the stone is another case.  With a round stones we generally see one, two, four, or six as ideal-options while with a pear-stone the bottom-prong is a chevron shape making five prongs in total.
