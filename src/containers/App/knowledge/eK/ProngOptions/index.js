      Single-prong settings are called Full-Bezels and are often seen as the most protective way to hold your diamond.  A seat is made for the diamond and encloses the entire stone; an advantage to this is higher protection from the stone being loose or coming out entirely, however the wearer must like the look of just the top of the stone rather than enjoying the beauty lost in the side-profile.

      Two-prong settings are called Semi-Bezels or tension-settings, with the latter being a type of setting we do not typically recommend due to the high stress is placed on the center-stone.  Semi-Bezels however offer the protection from the top and bottom, while show-casing the beauty of the side-stone.

    description:`
      Four-Prong settings are probably the most classic next to six-prong, and is seen in many examples of jewelry where a round center-stone is used.  Four-prong has the benefit of protection, for example if one prong gets pulled up, the remaining three will give the center-stone needed protection from falling out.  Besides the benefit of protection, four-prongs are aesthetically pleasing because it allows for the diamond to be seen from all-sides of the setting.  An under-bar can be done to any four—prong setting to reinforce the strength of the mounting.

      Six-prong settings are a classic in engagement-ring culture, often seen to great example with tiffany’s solitaire.  The six-prong is normally seen with each prong spaced evenly around the center-stone, and is seen mostly with round or oval diamonds.

      Eight-prong settings are seen quite often with fancy-cut center-stones such as cushions, radiant diamonds, and emeralds.  The prong thickness can be done quite thin since the main objective of this style is to curve the prong around the facet junctions of the corners, it can give an aesthetically pleasing look.
We commonly help customers remount their diamonds onto vintage/antique style rings to elevate their diamond in an elegant pattern. Oftentimes it’s reminiscence of art-deco design is highlighted as a key attraction. Its characteristic design can be found through the sellers Tacori and Beverley K who are well-known for using this style to show-case their pieces.
