    question: 'Why work with a smaller store?',
    answer:`
    Smaller stores offer more flexibility both in quality of service, pricing, and
    what lines they take-in from the larger industry.  We are able to pick and choose both fine jewelry and be selective in what diamonds we stock.  By doing this, we create a low over-head environment
    to pass the savings onto us and our customers.
