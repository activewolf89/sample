        We do not push any jewelry,diamonds, or gemstones that we do not want to keep in-stock; this is represented in our return policy and store information section, and diamond trade-up program found in our Policy Section.

    {title:'Guidance',
    description:`
    Guidance is probably the biggest differentiator we hear from our customers who come back time-and-time again, and refer their friends and family.  It is the time that we take to build a relationship with
    our customers that goes beyond the meet-and-greet, we take meeting you and getting to know your personal tastes as important steps to guiding you to the right piece of jewelry.

  {title:'Patience',
  description:`
    The average engagement ring customer will take about three visits before making any decisions which we encourage. If we were in the shoes of the shopper,
    it is an expensive and important purchase that we want there to be no regrets and as informed as possible; this goes back to our other points of Guidance and No-Pressure sales environment.

{title:'Quality Goods',
description:`
  It is hard to find the perfect trifecta of quality goods, fair pricing, and flexible options; you can find that at L T Denny Jewelers.  A single sale is not important as a life-long relationship built with our clients, and we
  will continue to find new goods for our events and for stock.

{title:'Quick Turnaround',
description:`
  When the time comes to select the piece of jewelry you want to make, order, or repair we have a goldsmith on-site and plenty of communication along the way to make sure logistics and clear vision gets
  dialed in.

      When a customer comes in we take the time to show a vetted selection of responsibly sourced loose diamonds, gemstones or mounting tailored to the customers tastes and preferences.
      We recommend setting up an appointment to come in and see what we have to offer; we build future wishlists in our system as well with exact measurements for future gifts as well!
