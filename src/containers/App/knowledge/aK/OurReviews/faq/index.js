    question: `What is your average review?`,

    question: `What is the most common theme that our customers say about us?`,
    answer:`
    The feedback we get is the patience and quality of service/jewelry we give our customers.  If it wasn't for their own patience throughout the process, this would not be possible as it is a
    two-way-street for trust.  We are non-commision-based, which can be felt in the feedback as it is soley trying to find what is right for the two of them.

    id:'3',
    image: '',
    question: `Do we pull our reviews from other sources besides Yelp and Google?`,
    answer:`
    No, our sources need to be from neutral places that are not pushed or filtering out poor reviews.  To see this, please visit our google or yelp pages and read through the feedback at their sites.
