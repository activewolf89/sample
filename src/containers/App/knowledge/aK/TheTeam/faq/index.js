    question: 'What makes us a family business',
    answer:`
    our two dogs, Biggie(dark) and Sissy(apricot) are brother and sisters; our Goldsmith Michael, and Andrea are father and daughter; and our store owner Leslie and Reed are mother and son.
    We are truly a small independant family business, and we treat our customers as family the moment they step through our doors.
