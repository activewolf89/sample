      Watches possess a simple appearance but underneath contains a complex system of moving parts designed to keep time down to the second.  We carry two main watch brands, Frederique Constant and Ebel, and
      both are swiss and fabulous watches in their own right.  The watches we carry can often exchange their strap, or be made with a different face color,etc.

      description:`
        The Bezel of the watch is the surrounding metal that creates the width and overall frame for the face itself.  Often-times steel, the bezel offers protection and style.  For lady's watches, we often seen steel being replaced with
        white-gold, yellow-gold,or rose-gold plating/pure.

      {title:'Bezel Width',
      description:`
        Bezel Width determines how easily the watch will read, in some cases lady's watches where widths are measured in MM and ranges from 20's to high 30's.  For gent's bands we see 36MM - 48MM as standard ranges.

    {title:'Strap',
    description:`
      Watch straps can either come leather or metal, often called a bracelet.  Leather watches often come with a croco/calf combination,an alligator strap, or satin.  The feeling of the strap determines the wearability of the watch,
      with a lighter strap such as leather being ideal for business/casual wear.  Metal watch straps come in gold or steel, and the bracelet itself creates a feeling of elegance and luxury that will last longer than leather.
