    question: 'What is some background info on these brands?',
    answer:`
    Frederique Constant is a relatively new player to the time-piece world, they have taken a lot of styles that have been popular from past designs, and remade them into fine-crafted time-pieces.  Ebel-Watch brand has been around for quite some time, and even after 20 years, our customers who wear them still come back saying they love this time-piece.  It is recommended every 2-3 years to get the watched service, similar to a car in that nature.

    question: 'What are my strap options?',
    answer:`
    Leather straps will wear lighter, and break into the wearerâ€™s natural wrist curvature.  Over-time due to the wear-n-tear of this material, it may not last as long as the metal bracelet.  The metal bracelet can hold the test of time longer, however it remains heavier, and a completely different look than the leather strap.
    Leather straps come in quite a bit of different colors, and is often found on a per-model basis, where some watches can interchange the straps for bracelets.
