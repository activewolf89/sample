    An automatic is a great option if you love the idea that the watch is being powered by your own movement.  If taken care of, an automatic will give you years of enjoyment without needing to replace the battery.

    question: 'I love technology, I like to wear my watch on occasion, and do not want to fuss over changing the time, what watch is best for me?',
    answer:`
      Smart watches are just going to get smarter with the software updates, so we would suggest looking into a classic-smartwatch.  These styles are reasonably priced starting around $950, and will tell exact time since it syncs to your phone, without needing to do any manual entry.
