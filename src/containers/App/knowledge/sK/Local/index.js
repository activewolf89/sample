      The idea of shipping Jewelry can get quite expensive, and often causes anxiety for us and our customers when losing packages in the mail is a possibility.  The first choice we make when
      creating a custom-job/repair is how can we do this locally.  When we work with our local network we can then bring jewelry to them or they come to us, which creates a system to track
      jobs much more precisely.

      We take pride that we give back to our community through employing specialists around the city, and are able to provide often-times rare skill-sets such as engraving and watch-repair, a means
      to continue their craft in a city that loves businesses and people that do their job well and love what they do.
