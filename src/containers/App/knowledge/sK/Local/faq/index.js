    question: `Where would I go get my watch fixed if not directly through L T Denny Jewelers?`,
    answer: `
    Watches should be repaired by the authorized watchmaker of the timepiece as they will have the correct parts, knowledge, and able to keep the watch in warrantee.  We use a company called Watchworks which is downtown Seattle that we have done business with for over 15 years.

    question: 'I want an appraisal on a piece of jewelry that did not come from L T Denny Jewelers, who would we suggest?',
    answer:`
    We do appraisals on jewelry that is from our store since we know exactly the origin and quality of the pieces.  That being said, it is on a case-by-case basis that we can write an appraisal for jewelry insurance on jewelry not from us.  The best thing to do is to ask us first, and we can direct you from there.  If you want to go directly to a fantastic appraiser, you can find
    the company Gemological Consulting Services located in downtown Seattle.

    question: 'Does your network of specialists work directly with the public?',
    answer:`
    Besides the two we mentioned, many specialists only work through retailers as they have a working relationship with the business and will know exactly how and what can be done.  Since we do so much business with our connections, our pricing will be the same as what the specialists would charge end consumers.
