      A few custom case examples we commonly work with and what that process looks like:

      {title:'Jewelry Repurposing',
      description:`
        Styles go in-and-out of fashion and often jewelry that was once worn gets shelved in the jewelry box for an occasion that may never come.  We believe jewelry should be made to be worn daily,
        and can be repurposed into a modern design that will elate. We will take one-side of a lost earring, and take the stone out, give 100% of the gold-melt value of the yellow-gold mounting and repurpose it within a
        pendant.  Another idea could be to build stackable rings that uses the existing earring-stone, and for example some old family stones.

    {title:'Custom Engagement Ring',
    description:`
      Our customer has a diamond he wants to set in a custom-mounting from L T Denny.  He brings in a classic solitaire, but wants a band to sit flush with the mounting, the center-diamond that his mother passed to him to sit low on the
      finger for daily wear.  Since the style may not be unique enough to force a wax, we can order the individual parts or create a CAD(computer-aided design) image to ensure this is the exact design he is looking for.  If there is any charge
      it would be the CAD design, and if he decides to go with the design or modify, we will apply the deposit to the ring.  After the ring is made, we have our gold-smith hand-set the diamonds, draft an appraisal and is ready for action.

  {title:'Stone Sourcing',
  description:`
    A customer comes in and wants a nice pair of sapphire earrings to celebrate her birthday coming up.  The first thing we want to know is the budget and size of stones she is looking for, as the first part of our job is to
    respect the budget and figure out logistics.  After we know she is looking for about 6.5MM rounds in a classic martini style white-gold setting, we source the stones and match them perfectly, making sure the depth of color and intensity
    is what is desired from our local Gemstone sourcing first if possible.  Once the customer comes in and takes a look at the stones and approves the earrings, we move onto finally setting and appraisal.

{title:'Engraving',
description:`
  We have sold our couple their wedding-bands, and they want both rings to be engraved the same date with initials.  For the gent's band, we have the option to
  machine-engrave on-site at no charge, however for a lady's band this band has to be done by hand or lazer, and requires additional experience.  We have our speciality setter that comes in, and we go over
  exactly what needs to be done on the inside of the band down to the spacing, font-style, and where the engraving is in relation to the metal-stamp.  The couple picks it up the next week in time for the wedding, and focuses on the happily ever after.
