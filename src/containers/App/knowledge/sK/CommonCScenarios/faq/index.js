    question: 'Is getting a piece of jewelry custom-made more expensive than buying from stock?',
    answer: `
    Custom-Jewelry is a great alternative to pre-made pieces, and it does not have to necessarily cost more than a piece already made.  The reason for this is that custom-made pieces do not have a shelf-life, the metal/stones are priced on current market-value and can be made exactly as requested.

    question: 'Can a piece of jewelry be made via photo?',
    answer:`
    Our full-time goldsmith on-site has had over 50 years of experience under his belt, he is in all eyes a master at his craft.  Anything that we can use from an image, or idea we can sketch out, carve out wax or extrude metal, and only until approval, do we collect a down-payment on the piece.

    question: 'What is the process like to create a custom piece?',
    answer:`
    An example of this process can be creating a fashion ring with an existing stone.  We would listen carefully to the requests, create a sketch and eventual wax of the piece.  This is a hand-carved wax typically or can be done with a molding of the ring if previously done before.  After this process and approval, we cast in whatever metal we would like, polish/finish coming back from our casters, set the center-stone and write up the appraisal.

    question:`
      Can existing gold be re-used towards a new design?
    `,
    answer: `
    Yes, gold can be re-used or recycled, and we offer exactly what is being offered to us by our refiners towards the job on-hand.  If the metal is sentimental, we can melt the metal and re-form it into whatever gauge we would like.
