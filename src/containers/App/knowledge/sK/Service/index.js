    A jewelry store needs to have a goldsmith on-site, there are a multitude of reasons why having a highly experienced jeweler is quite important.  A few of those reasons include
    technical advice when taking on a custom-piece, same-day repairs that are quite fast such as jewelry-stone tightening, and quality control where communication between client, jewelry assocaite, and goldsmith is key to get all the details perfect.

      description:`
        When you come into the store, and are settled, the first step we take is to come up with a multitude of solutions to the task at hand.  For custom-jobs we can use a photo, computer-aided design, or
        hand-sketch any idea you are looking to create.  After we have the design, Michael can draft a wax, and if its a simple design we will only charge after the wax gets cast into metal.  We are a small family-owned business
        that employs different specialists all over the city.

      back on you where it belongs.
