    question: 'If i want a quote on a job, how would we go about getting one?',
    answer:`
    If we can see the piece in person that is best, so making an appointment to come in would be ideal.  If you want a loose estimate, send us pitures, you can text us at 206-682-5555 or email us at Customerservice@ltdenny.com and we will do our best to give you a rough estimate.
