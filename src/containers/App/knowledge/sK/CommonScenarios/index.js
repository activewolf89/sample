      A few repair cases we commonly work through and what that process looks like:
    `,
    list: [
      {title:'Watch Service',
      description:`
        First step is listening to our client on what problems they are experiencing with the watch.  If this is a watch we sold we will have records
        and further information to determine within warrantee, and if not we will figure out which brand this watch is to determine what parts are needed.
        We want to work locally due to the numerous benefits, and we will contact our watchmaker we work with downtown to see if they service this particular piece.  If so, jobs are dropped off
        once a week and picked up no sooner than a week after the customer has been contacted and approves the repair.
      `
    },
    {title:'Ring Resizing',
    description:`
      Ring resizing can be accomplished within our store and should be done with the wearer present to get the precise finger-size.  We first determine what size with the knuckle in consideration,
      and we will cut the bottom of the shank until perfectly fitting.  This can be down to within quarter sizes, and to ensure the finger is not behaving abnormally such as really hot/cold we ask
      feeler questions to determine if this is a good average size to get good measurements.  After the measurement is taken, we have the wearer try on the ring, and once perfect we take the ring in to get
      lazer-soldered.  This process uses a large machine to melt the metal back to form a seamless connection throughout the ring.
    `
  },
  {title:'Stone tightening',
  description:`
    Stone tightening can be done in-house by our jeweler, and often goes unnoticed by our customers unless they specifically ask to have a stone tightened.  When any customer comes through our doors
    we ask to clean the rings, and in doing so check each stone to make sure there isnt anything loose in the mounting.  When we determine a stone is loose, no matter the size we can tighten while the customer
    waits.
  `
},
{title:'Ring Cleaning',
description:`
  Cleaning rings is important for us, as it lets us to check stones over and ensure that any ring from L T Denny Jewelers looks the best it possibly can.  No matter where the ring came from, we always ask
  to clean your ring when in, and anything else for that matter.  We use an ammonia watch 50/50 mixture with a hard-bristle
  toothbrush.  Besides the fact that ring-cleaning is a great way to provide a free service, we want to get to know the style the wearer enjoys to better tailor jewelry to show.
