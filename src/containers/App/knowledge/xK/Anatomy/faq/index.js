    question: 'Can my existing studs be reset into another setting?',
    answer: `
    Re-setting studs into a larger earring setting with diamonds or other stones is an excellent way to repurpose studs.  In Seattle, the focus is on every-day wear which we can make with a stud in smaller stones that surrounding the center.

    question: `When should I consider drops over studs?`,
    answer:`
    If you like the movement of drops and typically wear your hair down often, drops may be something to consider.  Studs can be worn more daily, however it also causes issues such as not ever taking studs off to clean.

    question: `What are the different kind of earring backs?`,
    answer:`
    While earring backs vary from metal alloy, to design, we suggest a simple jumbo-back ear-nut that is typically done in 14K gold.  The reason we suggest this is due to ease of use putting on and strength of tension on the post.  If you ever feel that the earring back is getting loose, we can tighten it at the store or you can tighten it yourself with needle-nose pliers on the two loops in the back.
    While screw backs in theory secure the earring, there is a natural disposition to leave the earrings on over-night this way or not taking them off as frequently.  These types of backs do start to unwind over-time, and may be less secure without knowing, as well as harder to put on then the jumbo-back ear-nuts.
