      Earrings are a beautiful addition to any jewelry collection, and can be done either studed,dropped, or hooped.  The question the wearer or the gifter needs to ask is,
      will the earring compliment the individuals ear-lobe, will hair be down enough that one cannot see the earrings, and what kind of backings will be best suited to hold the earrings in.

      {title:'Cluster',
      description:`
        A cluster design breaks the traditional sparkle of a diamond into many smaller stones grouped together, allowing for a larger look, a different sparkle, and less expensive than a single stud.
        The cluster also highlights the vintage beading around the stones, giving the mounting a classic look.

      {title:'Drop',
      description:`
        Drops create a dangle effect that can be seen when the wearer's hair is down, offering more visibility and motion.  This effect is opposite of a stud, however studs may be
        easier to wear on a daily basis.

    {title:'French Hooks',
    description:`
      French hooks or shephard hooks string through the ear and gets held in place by an attachment on the back of the cluster.  This style may be preferable if the wearer doesn't want to keep track of
      four different pieces for earrings to work -- both earrings and ear-nuts.

    description:`
      Ear-nuts are the most standard backing used to hold studs/hoops in.  In this exmaple we have a martini-style earring-setting holding diamond studs, with jumbo backs holding the setting.
      We recommend using large 14K ear-nuts, as they will hold the posts the best without being soft enough to easily loosen.  We do not recommend screw-backs because it is easier to not take them off, and
      they can rotate naturally without the wearer noticing.
