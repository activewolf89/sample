      Diamond earrings should focus on the sparkle of the stone rather than the color/clarity of the diamond itself.  When diamonds are set in earrings and on the ear, it is less likely
      that stones will be as highly scrutinized, and colors such as J/K with clarity SI2 are ideal candidates with a focus on ideal-cuts.

      Gemstone earrings will protect the stone since it will not be worn on the hand but further away from dangers! Softer stones such as emeralds, amethysts, and ruby/sapphire are all ideal stones for the center of earrings.

      Plain metal earrings are great to just focus on the color of the metal and texture of the design.  In the example we have millgrain along the edges of a bright polished earring.

      Pearl earrings are classic and are an excellent alternative to gemstones or diamonds.  We love the peach color of the example earrings, which goes well with yellow/rose gold.
      Be careful to not clean pearls in any cleaner, but rather warm water with a toothbrush.
