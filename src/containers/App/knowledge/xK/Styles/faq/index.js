    question: 'Should I consider earring-jackets?',
    answer:`
    Studs can either be mounted in a beautifully designed finding, or a classic plain solitaire â€” another option could be what is called an earring-jacket, which allows studs to be used interchangeably within the backing.

    question: 'What should I know about hoops?',
    answer:`
    Hoop earrings can be done with diamonds/gemstones or plain.  We recommend positioning any earring in a position to allow a natural lay on the ear, and can adjust the post accordingly.  A hoop can be done also with diamonds on the other side of the hoop, allowing maximal exposure to the sparkle.

    question: 'What should I know about dangles?',
    answer:`
    Dangles can be done any length, and should typically weight should be considered due to the fact that gravity can take a toll on the ear when worn too long.
