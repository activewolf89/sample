    question: 'Do designers price-set their pieces?',
    answer:`
    This answer varies, as a retailer we are under contract for certain designers such as Tacori, Simon G, and Chris Ploof to adhere to retail prices set-forth.  On certain event days that happen once or twice a month, we are able to offer incentives.  To find out when the next event for certain designers are, just ask us and we will be happy to let you know.

    question: 'I do not see a designer I am interested in listed on your website, can we get in the piece?',
    answer:`
    It depends on the designer, we just need to see a link of the piece in question.  If we know the style you are looking for, we can also show different designs that you may like as well from designers that we do have.
