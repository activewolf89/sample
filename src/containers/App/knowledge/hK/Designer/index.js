      Over the past 30 years we have met many artisans and designers through the trade, and have aligned our store with the one's that best represent the quality selection
      we want to provide our customers. What independant jewelry stores provide to our customers that big brands may not is our ability to pick and choose small groupings of pieces that we really like for our store,
      and are excited to show our customers, while not having to buy a massive selection and forcing that selection onto our customers.

      {title:'Why buy Designer Jewelry',
      description:`
      Representing brands for our store is a way to provide our customers a rich selection of styles that otherwise with an unlabeled line could not.
      There is a connotation that buying branded jewelry is more expensive, however that is not always the case.  Economies of scale for designers that focus on ladies bands for example
      can be seen in the price of the rings such as the Memoire bands we carry, which would otherwise be more expensive if we made in-house. What it comes down to is the particular look that appeals to the wearer, and if the brand represents the style, ethical stance, and beauty the wearer desires.

    {title:'What designers do we represent',
    description:`
      There are currently 450 designers we have purchased from in our history.  The reason we have this many is we buy a lot of one-off pieces from designers that allows us to provide a unique feel to our customers.  However, there are about 15 notable designers that
      can be searched off by consumers, allowing for notable mentions: Tacori, Benchmark, Ritani, Memoire, SimonG,Danhov, Forevermark, Precision Set,Doves, Suna Bros, Maevona, Frederic Sage, Stardust, Chris Ploof, Gumuchian, Jade Trau, Ebel, and Frederic Constant
