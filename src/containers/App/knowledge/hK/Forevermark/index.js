      {title:'Origin',
      description:`
      About 10-15 years ago, DeBeers changed ownership and a partnership with Botswana, the leading diamond source occurred, creating jobs and a higher standard of living
      for the people.  Responsible sourcing, and sustainable practices were put in place to not only protect and compensate the workers, but the environement and animals
      that lived within the region.

    {title:'Tracing Diamonds through the pipe',
    description:`
    99.8% of diamonds go through a standard called the Kimberley Process; however
    this does not guarantee origins, nor does it track the stone from where it's sourced to where it cuts after coming from the sourced countries.  Due to the high-demand for transparancy within the Diamond industry,
    a more detailed accounting of the stones origins had to be made.
    `
  },
  {title:'The Concept',
  description:`
  The concept of the Forevermark diamond, one that is rare, responsibly sourced, and beautiful was created allowing for quality checks and transparency to occur
  through the stringent tracking of diamonds from mine to finger(see inscription).

    The Inscription
  `,
  description:`
  The inscription number is the tracking mechanism that represents the diamond has been graded by Forevermark and checked through the whole process.  There is a high advantage for sourcing and grading to come from the same place,
  as not all diamonds can be Forevermark.  If the stone does not have a certain quality, be it cut, color or clarity it will not pass the test to be a Forevermark diamond.

    title:"Conclusion",
    description:`
      Around 2008 De Beers was faced with the opportunity to change the perception of diamonds entirely, and in order to maintain the purity of a diamond created the Forevermark stone.  This stone
      is not just about the diamond, but about the people they help improve from teaching diamond cutting in countries like Botswana which has a 20% stake in De Beers, to the environment which gets painstakingly placed back
      through its restoration programs.  We are proud to talk about Forevermark and carry this diamond alongside our GIA and AGS certified stones.
