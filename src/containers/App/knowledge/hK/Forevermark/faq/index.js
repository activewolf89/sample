    question: `What is Forevermark FireCushion?`,
    answer:`
    A FireCushion is the branded Cushion-cut we carry to maximum light return that rivals that of the round brilliant-cut.  The cushion-shaped diamond is cut with a round brilliant-cut like pavilion, which maximizes caret-weight, and high crown-angles which maximum light return.  In Essence, the wearer gets a brighter and larger-looking cushion diamond.
    The Forevermark part of the FireCushion is the sourcing of the stone, and the Cut itself is a FireCushion.

    question: `Where is the Forevermark Inscription located?`,
    answer:`
    The inscription can be located at the top part of the table of a Forevermark Diamond, and is used to track where the stone is mined from all the way to who possesses their stone in their mounting.  It can only be seen with a Forevermark reader as its a fraction the size of a strand of hair.
